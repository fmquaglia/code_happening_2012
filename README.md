End of the world hays in the wind
=================================

SCV Soft invites you to join their 2012 Code Happening. It's fun, it's easy, and you may win a cool prize.

## But what exactly is a Code Happening?

A Code Happening is like a [Hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon), but with a twist. In the end, all the individual works will get "merged" together and create something bigger, that will be a surprise for the participants. This loosely resembles the [Pop Art Happenings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening), from which we take the name.

## How can I participate?

First of all you need to fork this repo. In order to participate, you need to develop a simple web app and push it to your fork of the repo.

The app that you develop needs to meet the following criteria:

- It needs to be a **web app**. This is, it must run on a browser
- It needs to be a **single page app**. The user may interact with it by clicking, dragging, etc. but it shouldn't have real navigation (in the sense of going to another page) or form submission. You **can do ajaxing** of course, both to a server-side that would be part of the project, or to third party APIs (e.g. twitter)
- It must have a focus on **visual content**, rather than text. You can totally use text, but try to avoid tables, paragraphs, etc. Some examples of what we consider something with visual focus are: image slideshows, interactive games, tag clouds, charts, animations.
- It must be **loosely related to the year 2012**. Consider this as the topic for the app. Don't constrain your creativity: just have it a least somewhat related to it. Some examples may be doing a chronological sequence of 2012 events related to a particular subject, or an app that somehow relates to the end of the year, or a game about the holidays, etc.

Don't be afraid of keeping it simple or if you have little time to do it, we are looking for very **minimalistic** stuff this time.

You have time until **Thusday Dec. 20th EOD Pacific Time** to publish your work.

## What are the technical/formal requirements?

You can use any tech you want, as long as it can run as a web page. Client-side only with HTML5 and CSS3, any javascript library, server side with Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, Node.js.... you name it. The only requirement is that it must run on a single page on a single URL.

We care about *cross-browser compatibility* for modern, standard-compatible browsers (specially Firefox, Chrome and Safari). We don't care too much about IE on this particular case.

Your deliverable must have:

- A standard README.md file with clear and comprehesive instructions that allow us to deploy the app. Please remeber to mention any 3rd party library you are using and, if needed, how to get them. We strongly encourage you to use **open source libraries only**.
- All the neccessary code to have the app deployed and running (provided we followed the instructions on the readme) should be pushed to the master branch.
- Optionally, you can add an ABOUT.md file with extra information about who you are, what does the app do, etc. We encourage you to do so.

## Is there a winner and a prize?

Yes. We are going to evaluate every application we receive and qualify them with 1-5 stars on each one of these aspects:

- **Idea:** Its originality and innovation
- **Visual impact:** Its overall design and feel
- **Best practices:** Its code style and documentation
- **Technical execution:** Its overall performance and architecture choices
- **Relevancy:** How well it fits to the challenge functional and technical conditions


The app that has the best average ranking will be deemed the winner and its author will earn an **Amazon Kindle Paperwhite**

If you are neither in Argentina nor in the US, consider it may be harder (i.e. take longer) for us to get the prize shipped to you.

## Ok, I'm in. How do I stay up to date with the Happening?

Simply [follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/scvsoft). We'll communicate any updates on the challenge by that channel, including presenting you the "Happening" itself (i.e. the "merged" surprise for the participants), and announcing the winner.

## Copyright conditions

All the code you submit for the challenge remains yours entirely as intellectual property. If this little experience by chance becomes the trigger for you to develop a cool new app or component, we'll be very happy for you! We retain, though, the right to:

- Deploy and hosts the apps for a limited time (until March 2013 or earlier), for the purpose of the happening itself. We'll never charge a single penny for accesing the apps at any time while we have them deployed, nor include any advertising system, etc.
- Name you (actually, your GitHub user) as a participant of the Happening, and tell whatever you want to tell us about yourself or your app in the ABOUT.md page
- Publish the link of the Happening outcome (which will indirectly include your app) on social networks and other mediums, so it will be accessible to people that didn't take part of the Happening
