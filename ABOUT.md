End of the World Hay Stanzas in Fire
====================================

## About the application

This is a visual and textual random generator based on a Twitter scrapper, made as a desperate attempt to be part of the Code Happening 2012 organized by scvsoft

Voices on the internet (particularly Twitter) are brittle like dry hay leaves.
The fear or the faith (which are the opposite ends of the same thing) set on fire such voices.
Which I see is a colossal poem of fire.


## About the author

I've been obsessed by the automatic poetry generation.
A smart enough application could surf the internet, extracting bits and pieces here and there to compose a writing.
May be not a masterpiece, but certainly a reflexion of the _zeitgeist_.
This is a _late_ and humble attempt to give a step further onto that direction.
